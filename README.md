# Client-attrition using ML
#### Project Overview :
Employee Attrition is amongst major issues, daunting the HR department of every organisation.

Employee attrition is defined as the natural process by which employees leave the workforce – for example, through resignation for personal reasons or retirement – and are not immediately replaced.
It is a costly issue as the real cost of replacing an employee can be significantly high (specifically for management-level employees). The cost borne by the company is in terms of the recruitment process, traning of the new employee and the loss of productivity till the new employee achieves the benchmark. HR Analytics comprise of various programs to identify causes of attrition and subsequently improve retention rate through motivation and compensation systems.

#### Problem Statement 
With the aim to minimise the attrition rate, it is necassary to locate the areas of the organisation that contributes to the increasing employee attrition. The major goal of the HR deaprtment is to provide a working environment that enhances employee productivity. By performing root-cause analysis of why employees are leaving, HR can:

Implement programs to improve retention
Estimate the need of hiring in advance - to minimise the period of productivity loss due to vacancy.
In this project, we will address the following problems:
1. Which factors most contribute to the employee attrition?
2. Which employee is likely to leave the organisation?
3. Which programs can HR implement to reduce employee attrition?

We will address these questions with the help of machine learning algorithms.
